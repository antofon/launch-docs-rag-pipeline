Breakout Rooms is a new feature added to live classes on our platform. This feature allows teachers to divide learners into smaller groups (rooms) during live sessions, enabling more focused and interactive discussions.

- Teachers can now assign learners to Breakout Rooms during live classes.

- Teachers can broadcast announcements to all rooms or specific ones.

- Students cannot assign themselves to rooms.

- Breakout Rooms end when the teacher closes them.

1. During a live class, teachers have the option to create Breakout Rooms.

2. Teachers can assign learners to these rooms as needed.

3. Once in their assigned room, students can collaborate and discuss topics with their peers.

4. Teachers can join individual rooms or broadcast announcements to all rooms.

5. The teacher closes the Breakout Rooms when they are done.

- Group discussions and brainstorming sessions

- Collaborative problem-solving activities

- Peer tutoring and study groups

- Available for live classes with more than 5 students.

- Teachers cannot assign themselves to Breakout Rooms.

- If a teacher cancels a session, families receive standard credit within 7 business days. Credits are non-transferable and cannot be redeemed for cash.

- Do not request personal contact info (email, phone, address) from minors. All communication is via the parent/guardian account and official channels.

Previously, our live classes did not support breakout functionality.
